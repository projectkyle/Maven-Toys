A project that stitches together several datasets of a fictional toy store chain. This project orginated

The accompanying Tableau Dashboard can be found at this [link.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kyle.zhou/viz/MavenToys_17258582366480/Dashboard1)


### <ins> Some questions to answer: <ins>

1. Which stores generate the most profit?

    - Hypothesis: The downtown stores will generate the most profit.

2. Which products generate the most profit?

    - Hypothesis: Electronics will have the highest margin and also sell in high quantities. It will likely be the most profitable category with the most profitable products.

3. Which product category will likely continue to do well and which will do poorly?

    - Hypothesis: Consumers will be buying more electronics and less sports/outdoors products.
  

### <ins> Process <ins>

The dataset has several separate relational tables, I joined them into a single table for quality of life purposes. The individual tables originally held data regarding sales invoices, product category, and store information respectively.

### <ins> Analysis <ins>

Starting with the stores, the chain operates 50 stores in 4 types of locations (airport, commercial, downtown, and residntial). Within the 10 top earning stores, 5 of them are located in a downtown area, 2 in a commerical area, 2 in airports, and 1 in residential areas. 



The chain sells 35 different products for varying profit margins. The 10 products with the highest margins are seen below:

### <ins> Results: <ins>

1. Which stores generate the most profit?

    - While most stores are located downtown, the 2 highest earning stores are actually located at airports.

2. Which products generate the most profit?

    - Hypothesis: Electronics will have the highest margin and also sell in high quantities. It will likely be the most profitable category with the most profitable products.

3. Which product category will likely continue to do well and which will do poorly?

    - Hypothesis: Consumers will be buying more electronics and less sports/outdoors products.
